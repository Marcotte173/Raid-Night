  - "The Desert city of Lexisiva is the largest city on Degora. The Matriarchal Saurian
    port city is ruled by the Sorcerer Queen Rushasthihar\u200B, though in recent
    years her grasp on the city has become tenuous.\n\nThe self-styled Merchant Princes
    hatched a plot in secret to overthrow the city and in a single deadly night set
    their plan in motion. "
  - Weeks of fighting erupted, with painful losses on both sides as well as civilian
    casualties before a ceasefire was negotiated. The military fractured and both
    sides without a position to clearly retake power a cold war brewed.
  entry2Page:
  - The Merchant princes, mercenaries, and bought and paid for insiders in the military
    rose against mostly unsuspecting royalty and nobility and slew a number of nobles,
    the king and the princesses but thanks to the loyalty of large portions of the
    Lexisivan military and the royal guard the Queen and several powerful noble families
    survived the night.
  - 'For 10 years the citizens of Lexisiva have been waiting, knowing that war is
    coming, but not knowing what will reignite the conflict. '
