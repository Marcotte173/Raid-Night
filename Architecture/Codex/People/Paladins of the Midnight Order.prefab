  entry1Page:
  - 'Each god holds sway over a domain, an aspect of reality, an element, or a part
    of life. However interpretation can be tricky, read the texts one way and it
    says Ceres is the god of fire and the forge, another way the water of the forge
    is the key.


    The problem comes when the gods grant their favour to both
    types. And thus you get gods of duality worshipped as the god of life and death,
    might and weakness, Warfare and Peace. '
  entry2Page:
  - 'Whatever the gods actually stand for though, the people of Degora have their
    own opinions of those that worship Akalos as a god of death, or the followers
    of Ceres that read the passages about forging in fire and come to understand
    it as a call to burn people in the flame.


    Referring to themselves as the
    midnight orders of their religion it seems that some of them have banded together. '
